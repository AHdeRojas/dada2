CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.3
-----------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The vectorized aligner has been updated. It is now more flexible, handling different length sequences and variable end-gap penalties. It is also faster: On default settings the dada(...) function is now 15-25% faster, and isBimeraDenovo is 2-4x faster.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.2
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Species-level taxonomic assignment. The new assignSpecies(...) function uses exact matching to assign sequences to the species level. Currently a valid species training
fasta is only available for the RDP taxonomic database.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.1
-----------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed the memory leak in isBimeraDenovo and friends.

    o Sequence tables are now integer rather than numeric.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Multithreading. The dada(...) function is now multithreaded. This behavior is controlled by the multithread argument to the function, and is FALSE by default.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The phiX removal functionality in fastqFilter/fastqPairedFilter is now substantially faster.

BUG FIXES

    o Certain diagnostic return values of dada(..., pool=TRUE) are now appropriately constructed.

    o A 2-5% speedup from switching to C++11 hashed containers.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o The dada2 package is now available from Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org)


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.9
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o fastqFilter and fastqPairedFilter can now remove phiX contamination if rm.phix argument set to TRUE


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.8
-----------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Banding in nwalign is now turned off by default

BUG FIXES

    o Graceful handling of sequences which are not classified at any level by assignTaxonomy


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.7
-----------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o isBimera was rewritten in C, significantly increasing speed

BUG FIXES

    o An edge case bimera detection bug was fixed


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.6
-----------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Function documentation was reviewed and revised throughout the package


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.5
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o plotQualityProfile displays a visual summary of the quality scores over sequences in a fastq file
    
    o removeBimeraDenovo conveniently identifies and removes chimeras from the input unique sequences

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The dada2 package is now part of the devel branch of Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org)

BUG FIXES

    o assignTaxonomy now handles varying levels of taxonomic classification in the training data


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.10.7
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o dada2 now supports 454 pyrosequencing. When calling the dada function on 454 data, we recommend
       using the parameters USE_QUALS = FALSE, HOMOPOLYMER_GAP_PENALTY = -1, BAND_SIZE = 32

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o mergePairs is now "vectorized" over lists of input dada-class and derep-class objects

    o Added a homo_gap argument to nwalign which sets the homopolymer gap penalty in the N-W alignment

BUG FIXES

    o assignTaxonomy now uses less memory
